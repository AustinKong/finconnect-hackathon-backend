## Key Features Explained

### Auto-Staking
When enabled on a wallet, deposited funds are automatically staked in the yield-generating lending protocol. Users earn passive income while maintaining the ability to spend.

### Auto-Unstaking for POS
When making a purchase with insufficient balance, the system automatically unstakes the required amount from the lending protocol to complete the transaction.

### FX Conversion
All transactions in foreign currencies are automatically converted to USD using live exchange rates with a small markup. The original amount and currency are preserved in transaction metadata.

### Mission System
Users can enroll in missions and earn rewards by completing spending goals. The system automatically evaluates transactions against active missions and distributes rewards upon completion.

### Card-Based Payments
Users can issue virtual cards linked to their wallet. Cards enable secure POS transactions without exposing wallet credentials.
