## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AustinKong/finconnect-hackathon-backend.git
   cd finconnect-hackathon-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   This will:
   - Generate Prisma client
   - Run database migrations
   - Seed initial data (2 users, 10 merchants, 2 missions)

4. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Required configuration:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
   PORT=3000
   NODE_ENV=development
   STABLECOIN_YIELD_RATE=0.05
   VISA_PROCESSING_FEE=0.029
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here
   ```
   
   **Note**: Get your Clerk secret key from the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com). In test mode, authentication is bypassed for easier testing.

### Running the Application

**Development mode** (with hot reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Production mode**:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### Verify Installation

Test the server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2024-10-22T09:57:00.000Z"}
```

## Authentication

This API uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication. Protected endpoints require a valid Clerk session token.

### Using Protected Endpoints

Include the Clerk session token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/wallet \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_clerk_session_token>"
```

### Test Mode

When `NODE_ENV=test`, authentication is bypassed and you can use the `x-test-user-id` header for testing:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/wallet \
  -H "x-test-user-id: user-id-here"
```

### Protected Endpoints

The following endpoints require authentication (marked with "requires auth" in the API documentation):
- All `/wallet/*` endpoints (except health check)
- User-specific `/missions/*` endpoints
- User-specific `/analytics/*` endpoints
- The `/missions/claim-prototype` endpoint

## Key Features Explained

### Auto-Staking
When enabled on a wallet, deposited funds are automatically staked in the yield-generating lending protocol. Users earn passive income while maintaining the ability to spend.

### Auto-Unstaking for POS
When making a purchase with insufficient balance, the system automatically unstakes the required amount from the lending protocol to complete the transaction.

### FX Conversion
All transactions in foreign currencies are automatically converted to USD using live exchange rates with a small markup. The original amount and currency are preserved in transaction metadata.

### Mission System
Users can enroll in missions and earn rewards by completing spending goals. The system automatically evaluates transactions against active missions and distributes rewards upon completion.

### Card-Based Payments
Users can issue virtual cards linked to their wallet. Cards enable secure POS transactions without exposing wallet credentials.
